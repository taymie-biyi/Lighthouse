/*
    We've been given access to a database that contains all of the users for the PlentyOfDevs dating site. This database contains every user's date of birth, but users have complained about having to figure out someone's age using just their date of birth. In this challenge, we will write a function that determines someone's age, given their date of birth.

    Challenge
Instruction
Create a function to determine someone's age.

Define a function called ageCalculator. This function should take 3 parameters:

name – a string representing someone's name
yearOfBirth – a number representing their year of birth
currentYear – a number representing the current year
The ageCalculator function should return a string explaining how old the person is. For example, if we called ageCalculator("Suzie", 1983, 2015);, the return value should be as follows.

*/

function ageCalculator (name, yearOfBirth, currentYear) {
  let age = currentYear - yearOfBirth;
  return name + " is " + age + " years old.";
}

console.log(ageCalculator("Miranda", 1983, 2015));
console.log(ageCalculator("Ferdinand", 1988, 2015));
